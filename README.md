## Summary
  Beginning at the landing page, a user sees a registration form.  The form is used to create a new account for creating and
viewing gift registries.  Once registred the user can add gifts to their page by entering the gift name, link, and price. The user
has the ability to delete unwanted gifts from their page.  The home page also contains a search bar that allows users to search for gift registries
by username.  
  When viewing someone else's page, the user can click 'purchase' next to each gift to let others know the gift
has been purchased.  They also have the ability to add gift recommendations to the page.  The user has the ability to click 'logout'
once logged in, and it will return them to the landing page, with a login form.  If the user chooses not to logout, they will automatically
be redirected to their home page on next visit.
